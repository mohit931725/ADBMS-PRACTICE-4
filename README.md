fee-payments-acid-demo
This repository contains SQL scripts to demonstrate ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) using a simple FeePayments table. Each part highlights how databases enforce these properties through transactions.

acid_fee_payments.sql – Complete SQL script containing:
Table creation with constraints
Transactions to demonstrate Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
Rollback examples
Final verification query
📝 Problem Breakdown
✅ Part A – Insert Multiple Fee Payments
Inserts 3 fee payment records inside a transaction.
Demonstrates Atomicity & Durability (all inserts succeed, committed to DB).
✅ Part B – Rollback on Failed Payment
Inserts valid + invalid record (duplicate ID, negative amount).
Entire transaction rolled back.
Demonstrates Atomicity & Consistency.
✅ Part C – Simulate Partial Failure
Inserts one valid and one invalid record (NULL student name).
Rollback ensures neither record is saved.
Demonstrates all-or-none Atomicity.
✅ Part D – Verify ACID Compliance
Adds two valid records and commits.
Consistency: Constraints remain valid.
Isolation: Simulated by two sessions (uncommitted insert not visible to others).
Durability: Committed records persist even after crash.
📊 Final Output
Below is the final state of the FeePayments table after all parts:
